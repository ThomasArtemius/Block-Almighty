# Block-Almighty
Mini-Project Game for Artificial Intelligence Course.
There's a thief who stole a sacred artefact and you, The Angry God, need to stop him from escaping.
You have the power to add a block or remove a block on his path.
All you need to do is just left click on the available path to add the block and right click to remove a maze wall.
Prevent him from reaching the blue portal.
